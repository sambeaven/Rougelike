<h1>Rougelike</h1><p>This is my first attempt at writing a simple Roguelike. It's all very rough, and will probably remain that way!</p><p>(Yes, the typo is deliberate)</p><h2>Current Todos:</h2><ul><li>Monsters (movement etc)</li><li>Improve map system to make it a bit easier to customize dungeons for testing</li><li>Agent colours (i.e. colour for hero and for monsters)</li><li>Implement saving/loading</li><li>Random dungeon generation</li></ul><h2>Known Bugs:</h2><ul><li>Monsters don't move and post annoying messages if they can see you. This is for testing purposes, but it will be changing down the line.</li></ul>
