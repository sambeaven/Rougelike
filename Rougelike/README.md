# Rougelike

This is my first attempt at writing a simple Roguelike. It's all very rough, and will probably remain that way!

(Yes, the typo is deliberate)

## Current Todos:

- Introduce looser coupling so that we can actually unit test this mother hubbard
- Improve map system to make it a bit easier to customize dungeons for testing
- Agent colours (i.e. colour for hero and for monsters)
- Implement saving/loading
- Random dungeon/monster generation

## Known Bugs:


- Monsters can get stuck next to each other
- The game doesn't end nicely if you die

## Fixed Bugs:

<s>You get a 'Ouch! You walked into a wall' message when backtracking. This does not impede movement</s>
