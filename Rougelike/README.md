# Rougelike

This is my first attempt at writing a simple Roguelike. It's all very rough, and will probably remain that way!

(Yes, the typo is deliberate)

## Current Todos:

- Improve map system to make it a bit easier to customize dungeons for testing
- Implement saving/loading
- Random dungeon/monster generation

## Known Bugs:

- Monsters can get stuck next to each other
