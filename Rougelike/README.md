# Rougelike

This is my first attempt at writing a simple Roguelike. It's all very rough, and will probably remain that way!

(Yes, the typo is deliberate)

## Current Todos:

- Monsters (movement etc)
- Improve map system to make it a bit easier to customize dungeons for testing
- Agent colours (i.e. colour for hero and for monsters)
- Implement saving/loading
- Random dungeon generation

## Known Bugs:

- Monsters don't move and post annoying messages if they can see you. This is for testing purposes, but it will be changing down the line.
