# Rougelike

This is my first attempt at writing a simple Roguelike. It's all very rough, and will probably remain that way!

(Yes, the typo is deliberate)

## Current Todos:

- Monsters (movement etc)
- Agent colours (i.e. colour for hero and for monsters)
- Implement saving/loading
- Random dungeon generation

## Known Bugs:

I know of none, but give me a shout if you spot one!
