<h1>Rougelike</h1>

<p>This is my first attempt at writing a simple Roguelike. It's all very rough, and will probably remain that way!</p>

<p>(Yes, the typo is deliberate)</p>

<h2>Current Todos:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Doors</li>
<li>Unit test combat system<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Maybe check for balance while we're at it?</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Fog of war</li>
<li>Items and Equipment</li>
<li>Random dungeon generation</li>
<li>Random monster generation</li>
<li>Monster speed (slower monsters don't move every turn, faster monsters may move twice)</li>
<li>Time (certain actions take more time than others)</li>
<li>Give monsters a sense of object permanence (as in, able to follow the player when they can't see them)</li>
<li>Patrolling monsters</li>
<li>Crafting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Bugs:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Monsters can get stuck next to each other<br />
<ul><br />
<li>We need them to recognize when they can see the player but the destination cell is impassable, and then find a way around it.</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Dependency injection for the RLDice object isn't working at the moment, because I can't deserialize to an interface or abstract class.</li>
</ul>
